\
1) Unzip using win zip \
\
2) Apk is taken from Eclipse and its a debug APK which is not signed\
\
3) I have assumed that Network will be available ( there was no offline support added ) , a loading screen will come if no network is present\
\
4) Loading screen will come as soon as you launch the app and I triggered a AsyncTask in the background to fetch the details such as App name, rating , description price etc , as soon as fetching and parsing competed loading screen will be removed with list view\
\
5) API HIT COUNT and NO OF GAMES are added as footer, you need to scroll whole list to see this part , didn\'92t have time to make it stick able view\
\
6) for fetching API HIT count another async is triggered\
\
6) on click on the row item , Another activity will open which will have all details about app\
\
7) as soon as user click on list , another async task will be triggered to fetch the image\
\
8) BACK , APP STORE , SMS and SHARE buttons are working well\
\
9) showing the demographic data in the form of list view as don\'92t have time to convert into pie chart\
